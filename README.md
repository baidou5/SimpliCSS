# SimpliCSS

**SimpliCSS** is a lightweight and simplified utility-first CSS framework designed to make building modern, responsive websites easier. Inspired by frameworks like Tailwind CSS, SimpliCSS offers a simpler and more intuitive naming system, while still providing flexibility and power for creating beautiful UI and UX designs.

## Features
- **Utility-First**: Focus on small, reusable utility classes for rapid styling.
- **Simplified Class Names**: Short, easy-to-remember class names that speed up development.
- **Responsive Design**: Built-in media queries to ensure your website looks great on any screen.
- **Lightweight**: Minimalist design with only the essential utilities.
- **Customizable**: Easy to extend and modify for your project's needs.
- **Modern Flex and Grid**: Simple support for Flexbox and Grid layouts.

## Installation
You can easily include SimpliCSS in your project by downloading the `simpli.css` file and linking it to your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/simpli.css">
```

## How to Use
Simply apply the utility classes directly to your HTML elements, just like in Tailwind CSS:

```html
<div class="bg-blue text-white p-2 rounded-md shadow-md">
  This is a simple card component!
</div>
```

## Example
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>SimpliCSS Example</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="simpli.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="flex justify-center items-center h-screen bg-light">
    <div class="bg-blue text-white p-3 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
      Welcome to SimpliCSS!
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

## Customization
Feel free to modify the `simpli.css` file to fit your specific project needs. You can add or remove utilities and change default values as needed.
