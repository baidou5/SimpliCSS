## Installation

### Using the CDN

To include SimpliCSS via CDN, add the following link to your HTML's `<head>` section:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/baidou5/SimpliCSS@main/SimpliCSS/SimpliCSS.css">
```

### Local Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/baidou5/SimpliCSS.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd SimpliCSS
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Build the CSS:

   ```bash
   npm run build:css
   ```

5. Include the `SimpliCSS.css` file in your project:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/SimpliCSS.css">
   ```

## Usage

SimpliCSS utilizes simple utility classes to style your elements. Apply these classes to your HTML elements to quickly create layouts and style your content.

### Example Usage

```html
<div class="bg-blue text-white p-2 rounded-md shadow-md">
  This is a simple card component!
</div>
```

### Responsive Classes

SimpliCSS includes responsive utilities to control how elements behave on different screen sizes. For example:

```html
<div class="bg-light md:bg-dark lg:bg-black">
  Responsive background color change!
</div>
```

Here, the background color changes based on the screen size (`md` for medium screens and `lg` for large screens).

## Example Code

Here's a basic example of a webpage using SimpliCSS:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>SimpliCSS Example</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/SimpliCSS.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="flex justify-center items-center h-screen bg-light">
    <div class="bg-blue text-white p-3 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
      Welcome to SimpliCSS!
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

This creates a simple centered message with a blue background and a white text box.

## Customization

SimpliCSS is designed with simplicity in mind but is also fully customizable. To modify the framework:

1. Open `SimpliCSS.css` in your preferred code editor.
2. Adjust the styles, breakpoints, or add your own custom utility classes.
3. Save your changes and rebuild the CSS:

   ```bash
   npm run build:css
   ```

## Roadmap

Here are some planned features and improvements for SimpliCSS:

- **Component Support**: Include ready-made UI components (like buttons, cards, etc.) for even faster development.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Add utilities for dark mode styling.
- **Advanced Animations**: Include a utility-based animation system for adding transitions and effects.
- **More Flexibility**: Continue simplifying the customization process, allowing users to build their own version of SimpliCSS with ease.
